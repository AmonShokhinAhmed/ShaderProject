# ShaderProject
Project implementing different shader techniques for my Shader Programming course.

C++ Code is mainly based on [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Shaders).
Shader code takes inspiration from [Nvidia's Cascades Demo](http://www.geisswerks.com/about_cascades.html)

For now a procedural rock generation using marching cubes is implemented:

To build, use configure.bat, build.bat and run.bat in that order. This will only work on Windows.
